# PRODIGY_CS_01
The task is to create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on.
Caesar Cipher Example
Plaintext: "HELLO"
Shift value: 3
Encrypted text: "KHOOR"
